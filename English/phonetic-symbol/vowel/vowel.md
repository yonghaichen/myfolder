/ɝ/ : This is the sound in a stressed syllable or a one syllable word. When /ɝ/ is unstressed it is written /ɚ/.   
   

/ə/ : The vowel /ə/ is the most common sound in American English because of its use in unstressed syllables and words. It is called a schwa. When this sound is in a stressed syllable it is written /ʌ/.  


/ɔr/ : The ɔ used in /ɔr/ is not the same sound as the /ɔ/ in this app. (This is because the /ɔ/ used to describe many American Englsih words should be written /ɒ/.) The /ɔr/ sound begins with small rounded lips.    
  

/ɔ/ : This sound should be written /ɒ/ according to IPA. However, to be consistent with most dictionaries, /ɔ/ is used here.    
Note, though, that it is not the same sound as when /ɔ:/ is used to describe British pronunciation.    


/oʊ/ : Note that there is a slight difference from the British pronunciation of /əʊ/.   


/ɛr/ : The /ɛr/ sound is more correctly written /ɛɚ/ according to IPA. It is pronounced and written as /eə/ in British English.  


/ɪr/ : The /ɪr/ sound is more correctly written /ɪɚ/ according to IPA. It is pronounced as /ɪə/ in British English.
