Past tense modals are useful for expressing your present feelings about a past decision.

**Could Have** means that something was possible in the past, but it did not happen.

I could have travelled the world, but I never got a passport.



**Would Have** is a bit more complicated since it has two common meanings. But we will only talk about the one that shows how you wanted to do something in the past, but you could not.

I would have A, but I had to B.

I would have called, but I had to work.









Use have for all pronouns.
