If the underlying distribution is not known, then the sample variance may be computed as   

$$ s_N^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\overline x)^2 $$

where $\overline x$ is the sample mean.



Note that the sample variance $ s_N^2 $ defined above is not an unbiased estimator for the population variance $ \sigma^2 $. In order to obtain an unbiased estimator for $ \sigma^2 $, it is necessary to instead define a "bias-corrected sample variance"


$$ s_{N-1}^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\overline x)^2 $$
