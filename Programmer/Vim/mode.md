When you first open the VIM editor, you are in the **command mode** of the editor. The command mode is not an edit mode; it's just for typing commands.

**Insertion mode** is where you can type text normally. 

To get into **insertion mode**, type **i** (abbreviation for insert).

To get into **command mode**, press the **Esc** key.

If you're ever not sure which mode you're in, just press the **Esc** key and you'll be in command mode for sure.












Visual mode:  

        v       - enters visual mode.
        Shift+v - enters visual mode, where only lines (in full or none) can be selected. 
        Ctrl+v  - enters rectangular visual (block mode).
