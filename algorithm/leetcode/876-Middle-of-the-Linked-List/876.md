## 876. Middle of the Linked List


Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.  

If there are two middle nodes, return __the second middle__ node.  



__Example 1:__  
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```


__Example 2:__  
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```


__Constraints:__  
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
