## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List



Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the $n^{th}$ node from the end of the list and return its head.  


__Example 1:__  
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```


__Example 2:__  
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```


__Example 3:__
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```



__Constraints:__
* The number of nodes in the list is `sz`, `1 <= sz <= 30`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `1 <= n <= sz`
