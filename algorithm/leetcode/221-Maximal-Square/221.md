## 221. Maximal Square



Given an $m \times n$ binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return its area.   




__Example 1:__  
```
Input: matrix = [
    ["1","0","1","0","0"],
    ["1","0","1","1","1"],
    ["1","1","1","1","1"],
    ["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```



__Example 2:__
```
Input: matrix = [
    ["0","1"],
    ["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```



__Example 3:__
```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```


__Constraints:__  

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
